# Bayesian Vector Autoregressive Heterogeneous Modeling

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

This is a repository for researching Bayesian VHAR.

- Extend BVAR to vector HAR model
- Two-forms of priors: BVHAR-S and BVHAR-L
- Compare the forecasting performance

### Files

- [R/](https://github.com/ygeunkim/paper-bvhar/tree/master/r) Codes and R markdown
- [data/](https://github.com/ygeunkim/paper-bvhar/tree/master/data) Simulated and real datasets used in this research
- [docs/](https://github.com/ygeunkim/paper-bvhar/tree/master/docs) Rendered documents

### Tools

- `R`
- `LaTex`

### Required R packages

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)

## Results

### Simulation

- [DGP1](https://github.com/ygeunkim/paper-bvhar/blob/master/docs/model-dgp01.md) BVAR(5) with WN setting
